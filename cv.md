## About me
I work in the labor trade. My responsibilities include laying out goods, checking deadlines, inventorying goods, price tags, photo reports. The work is quite nervous and hard, and itâ€™s not that I feel in my place. I would like to try myself in other areas. Of my strengths, I can single out: responsibility, stress resistance, sociability and adaptability.
